        <span class="secondHeader">No text/No show</span>
        <p class="paragraph">If you don't show up for your appointment and do not communicate with me to let me know, you will be charged 50% of your service total. After the second no text/no show you will be charged (again) for 50% of your service and automatically blocked. If your payment is declined and does not go through, you will be automatically blocked.
            I have guests who are looking to get into appointments and when you no show you are taking away their opportunity to be seen as well as disrespecting my time and my business.</p>

        <span class="secondHeader">Please Note</span>
        <p class="paragraph">By adding your card information when booking does not mean that your card will be charged <em id="unless">UNLESS</em> you no text/no show. After your service you can choose to use whatever form of payment you like.</p>

        <span class="secondHeader">Late Policies</span>
        <p class="paragraph">I do allow a 10 minute grace period in case you are running a bit behind. This means that you must be <em id="inside">inside</em> the suite at the 10 minute mark. This does not include "pulling in" or "parking" texts. Finding parking, getting your things together and walking inside can add 5 minutes pushing you over the 10 minute mark. If you are not physically in the suite at the 10 minute mark you will be asked to reschedule. 
            My schedule does fill up so I ask that you respect my other guests time as well as my own, just like I respect the time that you have <em id="chosen">chosen</em> for your service.</p>

        
        <p class="paragraph">This is my full time job and not just a hobby. Please understand that when you do not show up to your appointment or do not show up on time you are hurting my business and disrespecting the rest of my guests who do come to their appointments on time.
            All I ask is to respect my time as well as my guests.</p>
