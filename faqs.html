    <h3>
        <span class="secondHeader">How awkward is it getting a Brazilian?</span>
        <p class="paragraph">It is not awkward at all! I talk the entire time and it's over before you know it. 
            Also, remember I've been doing this for over 3 and a half years and I have seen several hundred vaginas. This is what I do all day long so trust me it is not awkward. And always keep in mind that every woman's body is unique.</p>

        <span class="secondHeader">How painful is getting a Brazilian?</span>
        <p class="paragraph">I know the thought of getting your hair ripped off sounds terrifying but as crazy as it may sound it's not as painful as you think.
            I would never describe a Brazilian as painless, but it is less than what guests typically imagine.
            It also takes no longer than around 15 minutes. And the more consistent you are the less painful it becomes over time.  </p>
    
        <span class="secondHeader">What if I'm on my period?</span>
        <p class="paragraph"> If you are able to wear a tampon you can continue with your appointment. Keep in mind that you will feel more sensitive because your hormones are unbalanced. 
            If you are unable to wear a tampon, then you are welcome to reschedule. </p>
    
        <span class="secondHeader">Can I wax while pregnant?</span>
        <p class="paragraph">Always follow your doctor's recommendations, but on average, waxing while pregnant is safe.</p>
   
        <span class="secondHeader">How long after I give birth can I get waxed?</span>
        <p class="paragraph">Again, always follow your doctor's recommendations, but on average it is 6 to 8 weeks. If you have a cesarean I do not wax over the scar, but I do tweeze in order to avoid irritation.</p>
    
        <span class="secondHeader">If I wax my face will the hair grow back thicker?</span>
        <p class="paragraph">No. Waxing is not like shaving, so your hair won't grow back thicker.</p>
    
        <span class="secondHeader">If I wax often, will my skin become saggy?</span>
        <p class="paragraph">No. Waxing does not affect saging, that has to do with collagen. With hard wax, we are pulling the hair and not the skin.</p>

        <span class="secondHeader">Where can I find your prices and book an appointment?</span>
        <p class="paragraph">On the <a id="homeLink" href="index.html">home</a> page there is a "Book Appointment" button that will lead you to where you can book an appointment as well as see all services offered and pricing.</p>
